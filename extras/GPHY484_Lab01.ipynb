    "# Lab 1: Introduction to programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will introduce you to some basic programming concepts using the Python language. Python is relatively easy to learn, widely-used across industry and academia, and has many useful packages for map-making and data analysis. But, it's important to remember that there are many programming languages out there that can be used to accomplish a given task. This is not a Python programming course; instead, we hope you will learn to approach spatial problems from a programmatic perspective and implement solutions to those problems using the Python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Especially if you have limited experience with programming, some of these new concepts may be unintuitive at first. One important skill for a programmer is to know where to look for help. Even professional developers have many browser tabs open with code documentation, examples, and troubleshooting forums easily accessible. At the end of this notebook there is a list of [websites where you can go for help](#helpful_cell) if you get stuck.\n"
