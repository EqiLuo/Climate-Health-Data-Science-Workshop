# GPHY-491-591 Data Science for Sustainability

Developed by Cascade Tuholske, Montana State University  

While specifically developed for MSU students, this course leverages materials from [UCSB EDS2017](https://github.com/environmental-data-science/eds217_2023), developed by Prof. [Kelly Caylor](https://github.com/kcaylor), and from [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html), developed by Prof. [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat).

## Course Website

The course description, learning goals, format, and outline with links to all activities can found on [Bright Space / DSL](https://ecat.montana.edu/d2l/home/794961). 

## How to use this repository

1. Fork this repository to create a local copy in your github account. Do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the [repository home page](https://github.com/cascadet/GPHY-491-591).

1. Clone the forked repository to your local computer

	* Open your `Terminal`.

	* Type `git clone` and the the url for your forked copy of this repository, which is `https://github.com/<your username>/GPHY-491-591`, where <your username> is your github user id.

	     The entire command will look like this:

		`$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/GPHY-491-591`

		**Note:** In the line above, the `$` is your terminal prompt. On other systems, the command prompt is something like `>`, or `[username]$`. To keep these directions more general, I will just use `$` to represent the command prompt throughout our docs. The key point is that you *don't* need to type this as part of the command.

	* Press **Enter**. A local clone of the class repository will be created on your local computer.

		```
		$ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/GPHY-491-591
		Cloning into 'GPHY-491-591'...

		remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
		Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
		```

	     You will now have a new local directory in your instance called `GPHY-491-591/`, which contains all of the course materials. We will download and practice using all of the required software to use these course materials on Day 0 of the course.
